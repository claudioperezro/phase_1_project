# phase_1_project
Capstone project for phase 1 of the Flatiron Data Science Bootcamp. 

With the success that Netflix and other streaming services have seen from creating original movie productions in-house, Microsoft has decided to chip into the fun and start its own movie studio. Because theyâ€™re the new kids in the block, they need help finding out what can they learn from box office hits. Hopefully, Microsoft will use these insights and recommendations to decide where they want their studio to head in the future.


The goal of this project is to put in practice the skills related to data pre-processing, data visualization and insights from data.

The scope of this project includes:
    
- Use the provided data files 
- Answer 3 questions that will yield actionable business insights.
- Use visualizations to explain the conclussions
